# Bengaluru House Price Prediction Project

The construction of a real estate price prediction project is explained in detail in this series of data science projects. Firstly, I created a model using the Bengaluru Home Prices dataset from [kaggle](www.kaggle.com) and performed certain processes using linear regression to train the model to make appropriate predictions.

Nearly all data science principles, including data loading and cleaning, outlier identification and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, k fold cross validation, etc., were covered in the process of developing this model. 

A pickle file and a json file are also created along with the model in order enable other software developers to host the model on a website where people may freely access it and make predictions in an interactive way.






## Technology Used

**1.** Python

**2.** Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning

**3.** Matplotlib for data visualization

**4.** Sklearn for model building

**5.** Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
